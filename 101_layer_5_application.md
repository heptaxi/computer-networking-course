# Application layer
A TCP Message has a payload that can be used to transmit data for any type of application. This means there are also standards for each type of application, so that whatever the server or client, they can understand eachother.

Ex: HTTP (web browser/webserver), FTP, SMTP, AMQP etc

## OSI Model (7 layers model)
Open Systems Interconnection Model.

- 1) physical
- 2) data link
- 3) network
- 4) transport
- 5) session
    - responsible for facilitating communication between applications and transport layer (managed by the OS)
- 6) presentation
    - responsible for making sure that the unencapsulated application layer data is able to be understood by the app (Ex: compression/encryption of data)
- 7) application
