# Network Services

## Domain Name System (DNS)
a global and highly distributed network service that resolves domain names into IP addresses.

- domain name: is a human readable name that can be resolved by DNS

### Standard modern network configuration for a machine
- MAC Address (hardcoded)
- IP Address
- subnet mask
- gateway for a host
- DNS server

### Types of DNS Servers
- Caching (ISP or local network)
- Recursive (ISP or local network)
    - perform full DNS resolution request
- Root
    - 13 root servers, performing request to TLD servers
    - send a redirect to TLD server
- TLD (Top-Level Domain)
    - tld= last part of any domain
    - Ex: .com
- Authoritative
    - the final DNS server

### Anycast
A technique used to route traffic to different destinations depending on factors such as location, congeestion or link health.

Ex: you can send a Datagram to a specific IP but it could be router to many locations.

### Transport
With TCP: ~40 packets.
With UDP: 8 packets.

UDP DNS Server often uses PORT 53.

### Resource Record types
- A Record
    - used to point a certain domain name to a specific IPv4
    - multiple A Records for same domain help do Round-Robin
- AAAA Record (Quad A)
    - same as A Record but for IPv6
- CNAME Record (Canonical)
    - used to redirect to another domain
    - example redirect microsoft.com to www.microsoft.com
- MX Record (Mail Exchange)
    - make sure to differentiate Mail servers from web servers
- SRV Record (Service)
    - similar to MX but for other services than Mail
- TXT Record (Text)
    - initially some human readable description
    - now common to use it to serve info to a third-party email provider

### Domaoin Name structure
Ex: www.microsoft.com

- TLD (last part)
Top-level Domain. Managed by ICAN with IANA.
    Ex:
    - .com
    - .net
    - .io
    - .dev
    - .edu
    - .fr
    - .gov 
- Domain (second part)
    - used to demarcate where control moves from TLD name server to Authoritative name server
    - mostly managed by registrars
- Sub-domain

FQDN: Fully Qualified Domain Name = <sub>.<domain>.<tld>

DNS can technically support up to 127 levels for an FQDN.
Each section can be max 63 chars.
Max FQDN length is 255 chars.
