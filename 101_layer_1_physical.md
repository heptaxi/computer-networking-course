# Networking Devices
## Cables
- Copper: binary data represented by changing voltage.
Cat5, Cat5e, Cat6 cables depending on the specification and arrangement of indiividual cable thread.
- Fiber: made of glass fiber, binary data represented by ON/OFF light.

Twisted pair network cables can operate in a full-duplex mode (communication allowed synchronously in both directions).

## Hubs and Switches
Primary devices used to connect computers on a single network= LAN (Local Area Network).
Hub operates at layer 1, Switch operates at layer 2.
Switch inspects ethernet data.

## Router
Device that knows how to forward data between independant networks.
Router operates at layer 3.
Router inspects IP data.

Home Router, just get data from internal network and send it to the ISP. ISP Router is much more complexe.

Routers share data via BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), which lets them learn the most optimal paths to forward traffic.
