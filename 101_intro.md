## Definitions
- Protocol:
a sequence of steps required to setup a communication between devices

- Networking:
management of the communication, with setup, retries of failed paquets etc.

- TCP/IP model:
5 layers network model

- OSI model:
7 layers network model

## TCP/IP model

- layer 1 = physical layer
physical devices that interconnect computers.
Ex: cables
-> bits

- layer 2 = data link layer
a protocol defining a common way of interpreting signals so network devices can communicate.
Ex: ethernet or wifi
-> frames

- layer 3 = network link
allows different networks to communicate with each other through routers.
Ex: IP (Internet Protocol)

- layer 4 = transport layer
sorts out which client/app is supposed to get which packet of data.
Ex: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
TCP ensures reliable transmission, UDP does not.

- layer 5 = application layer
the real payload, consumable data.
